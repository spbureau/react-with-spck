# Learning React with Spck Editor

## This is a repo for learning React from mobile, using the Spck Code Editor

We continue learning regardless of the hurdles we face.

NB: Spck does not support function components, so I'm using just class components for this series.

Update: Function Component works now. I'm glad.
